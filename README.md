  <strong>A desktop pet that watches your screen and writes your daily diary with AI.</strong>
</p>



---

You juggle a dozen projects, switch between apps constantly, and at the end of the day you think: *"What did I actually do today?"*

Diaroo is a tiny pixel pet that lives on your desktop, quietly monitors your screen activity, and uses AI to generate a human-readable daily diary — complete with timeline, app usage stats, and focus analysis. It's like a personal assistant that watched over your shoulder all day and wrote your standup for you.
